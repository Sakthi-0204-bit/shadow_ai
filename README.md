## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (What It's Made Of)

We built Shadow AI using a powerful combination of industry-standard tools. Think of it as the foundation and frame of a high-tech building:

| Category | Technology | Why We Used It (The "Human" Reason) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | **HTML** | The basic blueprint; defines where the chat window, buttons, and text areas go. |
| **Style** | **CSS (Tailwind CSS)** | The paint and interior design; lets us style everything quickly without writing endless custom rules. |
| **Logic/Brain** | **JavaScript (React & TypeScript)** | The mechanics that make it work\! **React** handles the complex chat interface, and **TypeScript** helps us catch mistakes early by adding type checks. |
| **Components** | **shadcn-ui** | Ready-made, highly accessible pieces (like buttons and cards) that saved us time and ensured quality. |
| **Tooling** | **Vite** | The super-fast construction crew; it builds and serves the project almost instantly, especially during development. |
